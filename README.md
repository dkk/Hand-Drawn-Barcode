# Hand-Drawn-Barcode

This repository is related to the master thesis "A Hand-Drawn Barcode", submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of "Master in Artificial Intelligence and Depp Learning" at the University at Alcalá by Daniel Klöck on October 2020.

The repository is organized by following chapters of the thesis:

* The second chapter, which discusses the generation of a barcode that can be hand-drawn.
* The third chapter, which defines a process to recognize such a barcode, trains the necessary models and evaluates them.
* The forth chapter, which proposes encoding and deconding mechanisms while evaluating error probabilities.
